## User Stories

 - As someone interested in cellular automata, I would like an application to visually see the results of changing rulesets in cellular automata
 - As someone intersted in cellular automata, I would like to understand how neighborhood shapes and sizes affect the ending simulation
 - As someone interested in cellular automata, I would like an application that allows me to configure competing rulesets in cellular automata
 - As someone interested in 2D simulations, I would like an easy to use web-application to see what kind of cool looking patterns I can create using cellular automata
